# Sonic Explorations on Twitter

**Data** Twitter API, LDA, tSNE.js 
**Sound** Magenta's MusicVAE, Tone.js 
**Visual** p5.js

This project uses real-time data to build a 3D space exploring the dynamics of tweets on some defined time window (one hour here).

The 3D space is generated by doing LDA on the tweets text data and then reduced dimensionally with tSNE. The coordinates obtained from this dimensionality reduction is rendered on the web-browser with p5.js.

The sonification process goes according to the dynamics of the tweets, the space generated by them is then casted to the interpolation generated with Magenta's MusicVAE.

## Installation

Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sduquemesa/twitter-lda-tsne.git
cd twitter-lda-tsne
```

For node packages
```bash
npm install
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the python libraries.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

and set your twitter dev keys on a .env file on the root working directory

```
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY = [fill this]
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET = [and this]
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY = [this as well]
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = [and finally...]
```

## Usage

```bash
node app.js
```
and then check [localhost:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)
